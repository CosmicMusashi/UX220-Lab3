                I’m not much of a movie watcher so I don’t have that many movies to choose from but out of the small collection that I have watched the movie I would choose is a Japanese animated movie named Kizumonogatari 3 <Cold-Blooded></Cold-Blooded>. As the title implies this movie is a third installment of a series of movies, and it serves to be the final installment of the trilogy. The general story of the movie series follows the main protagonist assembling the sealed remains of a vampire queen that he made a deal with. Within the movie, the protagonist had finished upholding his end of the bargain. Upon completing his end he is backstabbed in a sense that’s kind of complicated to explain. Nonetheless this results in a final battle that balances, a comedic presence, while being unsettling at the same time

                With the moving being aired 2017 the movie is not oldest but it is by no means anything recent. A problem that I have with older shows is that their age is apparent most evidently within the animation quality. This movie doesn't have that issue. In a unusual twist is that this series of movies serves as a prequel sequel to an animated series. This means that these movies were released as a sequel but story-wise the events in the movie occur before the events of the show. Overall this movie was a thrill to watch, and served as an excellent way to cap off its trilogy.
